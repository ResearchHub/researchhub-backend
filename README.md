# ‚öôÔ∏è Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

## Prerequisites

- _(Optional, `macOS`)_ [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for simple installations using the `brew` command
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/):
  ```shell
  brew install docker
  ```
- IDE with Dev Container support:
  - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) _(Recommended)_:
    ```shell
    brew install visual-studio-code
    ```
    - Install extensions:
      - [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers):
        ```shell
        code --install-extension ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack
        ```
  - [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
    - Enable built-in plugins:
      - `Remote Development Gateway`
      - `Remote Execution Agent`
    - Install plugins:
      - [Docker](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7724-docker)
      - [Dev Containers](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/21962-dev-containers)
    - Install [Gateway](https://www.jetbrains.com/remote-development/gateway/) for isolated remote IDE instance _(Recommended)_
- Database client
  - [Postico 2](https://eggerapps.at/postico2/) _(Recommended)_
  - [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/)
    - Might be preferred if using PyCharm, since it's in the JetBrains ecosystem

## Setup

1. Copy the sample configuration files to `config_local` and adjust as needed:
    ```shell
    cp db_config.sample.py src/config_local/db.py
    cp keys.sample.py src/config_local/keys.py
    ```
2. Launch Docker
   - You can safely close its window, its daemon will continue running in the background
3. Open the project in your IDE
   - It will recognize the Dev Container configuration and prompt to `Rebuild and Reopen in Container` (or `Reopen in Container`)
     - This will pull and run all necessary auxiliary services including OpenSearch, PostgreSQL, and Redis. It will also download and install all Python dependencies, and perform an initial database migration.
   - If the Dev Container's IDE instance doesn't automatically recognize the Python interpreter, point it to `.venv/bin/python`
4. Add the `PostgreSQL` database to your client
   - [Run the app](#run-the-app) to ensure the database is running
   - Name/User/Password/Database: `researchhub`
   - Host: `localhost`
   - Port: `5432`
   - Update `src/config_local/db.py` with the above values for parity

## Run the app

- You can run the Dev Container's Django application one of two ways:
  - Directly in your IDE via its respective `Run` tool
  - Manually in the IDE's shell:
    ```shell
    cd src
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
- The app will be available at http://localhost:8000
  - Or http://127.0.0.1:8000, depending on your setup
- Test that the app is running by adding any random string to the end of the URL (ex: http://localhost:8000/abc)
  - If successful, you should see a `Page not found (404)` error page showing a list of the app's URL patterns
- [Run Celery](#background-tasks) if you want to simulate background updates

## Seed the Database

1. Run any data migrations and ensure schemas are up to date:
   ```shell
   python src/manage.py migrate
   ```
2. Initialize Google auth, hub categories, and hubs:
   ```shell
   python src/manage.py setup
   ```
3. Run each of the following commands and stop them (`ctrl+c`) after a short while (~10 pages should suffice, no need to pull all of it)
   1. Load Institutions:
      ```shell
      python src/manage.py load_institutions_from_openalex
      ```
   2. Load Topics:
      ```shell
      python src/manage.py load_topics_from_openalex
      ```
      - If you see `duplicate key value violates unique constraint "hub_hub_pkey" ‚Ä¶ Key (id)=(N) already exists` in the output, your Postgres sequence for `hub_hub.id` may be out of sync. Run this in your DB console, then try again:
        ```sql
        SELECT setval(
          pg_get_serial_sequence('"hub_hub"', 'id'),
          COALESCE((SELECT MAX(id) FROM "hub_hub"), 1),
          true
        );
        ```
   3. Load Concepts: 
      ```shell
      python src/manage.py add_all_openalex_concepts
      ```
   4. Load Papers:
      ```shell
      python src/manage.py load_works_from_openalex --mode fetch --journal BIORXIV
      ```
      - If you see `There are pending logs for this journal: {journal_name}` in the output, there are lingering journals that you can safely clear out. Run this command (replacing `{journal_name}`), then try again:
        ```shell
         python src/manage.py fail_fetch_logs {journal_name}
        ```
4. Populate Feed:
   1. Create entries from papers:
      ```shell
      python src/manage.py create_feed_entries
      ```
   2. Set a placeholder Journal ID using one of the journals that was seeded:
      1. Open a Django shell:
         ```shell
         python src/manage.py shell
         ```
      2. Query Journals:
         ```python
         from hub.models import Hub
         Hub.objects.filter(namespace='journal').values('id', 'name')
         ```
      3. You'll see result(s) like this:
         ```shell
         <QuerySet [{'id': 2280, 'name': 'bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory)'}]>
         ```
      4. Set that `id` as the value of `RESEARCHHUB_JOURNAL_ID` in `src/config_local/keys.py`
         - Use the first one if you see multiple results
   3. Update entries with data:
      ```shell
      python src/manage.py populate_feed_entries --all
      ```
   4. Refresh materialized feed views:
      ```shell
      python src/manage.py refresh_feed
      ```
   5. Reindex (for search, etc.):
      ```shell
      python src/manage.py opensearch index rebuild --force
      ```

## Debugging

**VSCode**:
- Modify `.vscode/launch.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
      {
        "name": "Python: Django",
        "type": "debugpy",
        "request": "launch",
        "program": "${workspaceFolder}/src/manage.py",
        "args": ["runserver", "[::]:8000"],
        "django": true,
        "autoStartBrowser": false
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
**PyCharm**:
- Add a new `Django Server` run configuration:
  - Name: `Debug` (or whatever you want)
  - Host: `[::]`
  - Port: `8000`
  - Environment variables: `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1;DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=researchhub.settings`

---

## Testing

To run the test suite,`cd` into `src` first.  
Look for `OK` message at the end of each test.
- Run all tests (remove `--keepdb` to clean up the test database after each test, instead of keeping it around for faster testing):
  ```shell
  python manage.py test --keepdb
  ```
- Run tests for the paper app (excluding ones that require AWS secrets):
  ```shell
  python manage.py test paper --exclude-tag=aws
  ```
- Run a specific test example:
  ```shell 
  python manage.py test note.tests.test_note_api.NoteTests.test_create_workspace_note --keepdb
  ```

---

## Background Tasks

ResearchHub uses [Celery](https://github.com/celery/celery/) for background task processing.

- Start a worker that processes background tasks asynchronously:
  ```shell
  celery -A researchhub worker -l info
  ```
- Start a scheduler for periodic tasks like feed refreshes, bounty checks, etc. (above command must be running):
  ```shell
  celery -A researchhub beat -l info
  ```
- Both commands in one (local dev only)
  ```shell
  celery -A researchhub worker -l info -B
  ```

---

## Additional Commands

- ResearchHub uses [OpenSearch](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch) for search and browse. To index entities (users, papers, etc...) at any time, run:
  ```shell
  python manage.py opensearch index rebuild
  ```
- Add new Python packages:

  ```shell
  uv add package_name
  ```

---

## Additional Information
- Dev Container's Django app
  - If it's running when repository changes are pulled, you'll need to restart the app for the changes to take effect
  - Rebuilding the Dev Container is only necessary when something changes that affects the image (uncommon), such as changes to the `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, or `devcontainer.json`

---

## Troubleshooting

**VSCode**:
- Nothing yet!

**PyCharm**:
- If your Dev Container launches but doesn't activate any ports (you don't see port numbers listed next to the containers in `Docker`):
  1. Stop and delete all containers, volumes, and images in `Docker`
  2. Create or update `.devcontainer/docker-compose.local.yml`:
     ```yaml
     services:
     postgres:
       ports: ["5432:5432"]
     redis:
       ports: ["6379:6379"]
     opensearch:
       ports: ["9200:9200"]
     opensearch-dashboards:
       ports: ["5601:5601"]
     app:
        ports: ["8000:8000"]
     ```
  3. Manually initialize the `Docker` containers:
     ```shell
     docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.local.yml up -d
     ```
  4. Open your IDE back up and try launching the Dev Container again
