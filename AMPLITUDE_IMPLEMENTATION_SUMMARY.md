# Amplitude Webhook + AWS Personalize Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation creates a comprehensive system for tracking user interactions and generating personalized content recommendations. The system receives events from Amplitude, processes them with intelligent weighting, and sends them to AWS Personalize for ML-powered recommendations.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Webhook Endpoint (`/webhooks/amplitude/`)
- Receives all events from Amplitude
- Processes multiple events in one request
- Handles errors gracefully
- Returns processing statistics

### 2. Event Processing & Weighting
- Filters ML-relevant events only
- Assigns weights based on importance (3.0 to -2.5)
- Differentiates between interactions and impressions
- Sends to AWS Personalize (when configured)

### 3. AWS Personalize Integration
- Sends interaction events
- Sends impression data (critical for negative signals)
- Retrieves personalized recommendations
- Gets similar items

### 4. Database Storage (Future Enhancement)
- Placeholder models for future implementation
- Comments in code show where to add database storage
- Enables historical analysis and offline processing

## Event Weights

| Event | Weight | Type | Description |
|-------|--------|------|-------------|
| fundraise/donate | 3.0 | Positive | Strongest signal - financial contribution |
| upvote | 2.0 | Positive | Explicit support |
| share | 2.0 | Positive | User recommends to others |
| bookmark | 1.8 | Positive | Save for later |
| download | 1.5 | Positive | Saving resource |
| comment | 1.5 | Positive | Engagement |
| click | 1.0 | Positive | Basic interest |
| scroll_impression | 0.7 | Positive | Confirmed view |
| view | 0.5 | Positive | Passive exposure |
| initial_impression | 0.3 | Positive | Possible view |
| hide | -0.5 | Negative | Doesn't want to see |
| not_interested | -0.8 | Negative | Explicit negative |
| downvote | -1.0 | Negative | Disagreement |
| flag_content | -2.5 | Negative | Strongest negative |

## Next Steps

### 1. Configure Amplitude
- Add webhook destination in Amplitude dashboard
- Set URL: `https://your-domain.com/webhooks/amplitude/`
- Enable event forwarding

### 2. Set Environment Variables
```bash
# Amplitude
AMPLITUDE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here

# AWS Personalize (optional)
AWS_PERSONALIZE_TRACKING_ID=your_tracking_id
AWS_PERSONALIZE_CAMPAIGN_ARN=arn:aws:personalize:region:account:campaign/name
AWS_PERSONALIZE_SIMS_CAMPAIGN_ARN=arn:aws:personalize:region:account:campaign/sims-name
```

### 3. Test the Implementation
```bash
# Run tests
python manage.py test analytics.tests

# Test webhook locally
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/webhooks/amplitude/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "events": [{
      "event_type": "click",
      "user_id": "1",
      "event_properties": {
        "item_id": "doc_123"
      },
      "time": 1234567890000
    }]
  }'
```

### 4. Deploy and Monitor
- Deploy to staging/production
- Monitor logs for events being processed
- Set up AWS Personalize when ready for ML recommendations

## Database Storage (Future Enhancement)

Currently, the system processes events and sends them to AWS Personalize without storing them locally.

**Future Enhancement**: Add database storage for:
- User interactions (clicks, upvotes, etc.)
- Impression events (what users saw)
- Cached recommendations

This will enable:
- Historical analysis
- Offline processing
- Reduced AWS API calls
- Better debugging and monitoring

**Implementation**: Uncomment the TODO sections in `event_processor.py` and add the models from `models.py` comments.
