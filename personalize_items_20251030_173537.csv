1. Overview

Provide a brief overview of: (1) scientific rationale and importance, (2) confirmation of funding/facilities/ethics approvals, (3) estimated timeline, and (4) data sharing commitment.

2. Introduction

Summarize theoretical background, key literature, research questions, and numbered hypotheses (H1, H2, etc.). Explain the study's importance  with an impact statement, regardless of potential outcomes.

3. Methods

Participants/Sample

Define target sample, inclusion/exclusion criteria, recruitment strategy, and sample size justification (including power analysis).

Materials and Procedures

Describe experimental/observational procedures, stimuli, tasks, equipment, and data collection settings with sufficient detail for replication.

Planned Analyses

Outline analysis pipeline, preprocessing steps, statistical tests, and hypothesis-specific predictions. Include any contingent analysis decisions as IF-THEN statements.

Ethics and Data Management

State ethical approval status or plan, confidentiality measures, and data sharing/archiving plan.

4. Pilot Data (Optional)

Summarize any pilot data or simulations that demonstrate method feasibility and inform power analysis. Clearly distinguish from main study.

5. Budget

Provide an itemized list of anticipated costs (materials, personnel, etc.). These are not binding and are able to be adjusted based on the results of the pilot data.

6. References

List all references used in the manuscript using Nature style (e.g. numbered in-text citations and alphabetical references at the end of the manuscript). neuroscience,cerebrospinal fluid",Grant Proposal Template,1,,,,False,False,True,False,False,False
