                <p>A search of PubMed and MEDLINE for articles on ambulatory
                    management of pneumothorax published up to Dec 5, 2019,
                    with the keywords “pneumothorax”, “ambulatory”, “Heimlich
                    valve”, and “outpatient” showed that most studies were case
                    series and included two small, inadequately powered
                    randomised trials. In 2013, a systematic review of 18 studies
                    found that although ambulatory options might be successful,
                    the data were of poor quality with a high risk of bias. A further
                    three case series were subsequently published. Given this
                    uncertain evidence base, we designed the Randomised
                    Ambulatory Management of Primary Pneumothorax trial as a
                    controlled study to determine whether ambulatory

                    The Randomised Ambulatory Management of Primary
                    Pneumothorax (RAMPP) trial was done to determine
                    whether ambulatory management of patients with
                    primary spontaneous pneumothorax is safe and reduces
                    the length of hospitalisation.

                            denfiition). Once a patient was identiefid as having a

                            intervene was made on the basis of current BTS
                            guidelines: patients were enrolled if they had a large

                <p>This study, which to our knowledge is the only large randomised
                    trial of its kind, found that ambulatory management of patients

                    the length of hospitalisation compared with standard care.
                    Ambulatory patients had fewer pleural procedures, but serious
                    adverse events were higher because of hospital re-admission.

                    requiring intervention could be enrolled and randomly
                    assigned up to 24 h after presentation, provided that they
                    remained hospitalised with an ongoing symptomatic

                    treated initially with aspiration and observed overnight)
                    requiring chest tube insertion. Patients not requiring an

                        coordinator or local Principal Investigator. Following
                        device insertion, patients were observed for 1–2 h to assess
                        them for clinical stability, after which a chest radiograph
                        was done (appendix p 44).
                    </p>
                    <p>If the chest radiograph showed insucfiient lung re ­
                        expansion, the ambulatory device remained in situ and
                        the patient was discharged, as long as the prespeciefid
                        criteria of tfiness for discharge were fullfiled. These
                        criteria consisted of all of the following: the patient agreed,
                        had clinically stable cardiorespiratory observations, had
                        no increase in the size of pneumothorax since the last
                        radiograph or review, did not require oxygen or other
                        respiratory support, was mobile and able to self­ care, was
                        provided with written information on point of contact and
                        follow­ up plan, and lives with a responsible person at
                        home. Any patient not meeting these criteria remained
                        hospitalised and was reviewed daily. Sucfiient lung re ­
                        expansion was denfied as complete or almost complete
                        re­ expansion (&lt;1 cm rim of air apically on chest
                        radiograph) and being unable to aspirate air through the
                        device using a connector and syringe.
                    </p>
                    <p>If discharged home with the device in situ, patients
                        were reviewed as an outpatient every 1–2 days (generally
                        daily, but a single review during the weekend was
                        suficient if clinically stable) until day 4, at which stage
                        the patient should be considered for thoracic surgery.
                        The timing of the ongoing outpatient review after day 4
                        was at the discretion of the responsible clinician. After
                        each review, if there was suficient re ­ expansion of the
                        lung and no ongoing air leak, the device was removed
                        and the patient was discharged. A postremoval chest
                        radiograph was done to ensure that the lung had not
                        recollapsed. If the chest radiograph showed recurrence
                        of pneumothorax, the patient was rehospitalised for
                        observation and consideration of the placement of a
                        standard chest tube connected to an underwater seal.
                    </p>
                    <p>Patients who were in the control arm received standard
                        treatment as per the 2010 BTS Pleural Guidelines.4 In
                        brief, pleural aspiration (if the clinician deemed it
                        appropriate) was attempted under local anaesthetic using
                        a 14–16 gauge cannula and syringe, aspirating a maximum
                        of 2·5 L. The patient was observed for 1–2 h to assess for
                        clinical stability, and a repeat chest radiograph was done.
                        If the repeat chest radiograph showed sucfiient lung re ­
                        expansion, the patient was discharged. If the lung had not
                        sucfiiently re ­ expanded, then a small­ bore chest tube
                        (≤14 F) was inserted and attached to an underwater seal,
                        and the patient was admitted to hospital.
                    </p>
                    <p>Although initial aspiration was recommended in the
                        trial protocol, the responsible clinician was able to
                        proceed directly to chest tube insertion and admission at
                        their discretion, in line with BTS guidelines.4 Decisions
                        regarding chest tube removal were as per standard
                        practice at participating centres but included no further
                        air leak (as shown by a non­ bubbling chest tube) and full
                        lung expansion on chest radiograph. A postremoval chest
                        radiograph was done to ensure that the lung had not
                        recollapsed. Fitness for discharge criteria were assessed
                        daily to provide equality between treatment groups.
                        Evidence for the use of suction in patients with pneu­
                        mothorax is poor. BTS guidelines suggest that high
                        volume, low pressure suction should not be routinely
                        used but could be considered if there is prolonged air
                        leak.4 Use of suction was at the discretion of the local
                        responsible clinician.
                    </p>
                    <p>Patients were followed up at 1 week after the completion
                        of treatment, and 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months after
                        randomisation. Hospital admissions and pneumothorax
                        recurrence were measured up to the day 30 follow­ up
                        point, and at each follow­ up point, data were collected on
                        further hospital admissions, pain and breathlessness
                        visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, quality of life, and
                        smoking status. Patients who were not able to attend
                        face­ to­ face follow­ up appointments were contacted by
                        telephone to check for complications or recurrence, and
                        if this was not possible, data on recurrence was collected
                        through hospital or general practitioner medical records.
                        Data on pneumothorax recurrence at 6 and 12 months
                        will be presented separately with data from the obser­
                        vational cohort.

                    <title>Outcomes</title>
                    <p>The primary outcome was the total length of hospital stay
                        up to 30 days after randomisation, including initial
                        hospital stay and re­ admissions. Patients remaining in
                        hospital overnight were recorded as having a 1­ day stay;
                        those discharged on the same day (either after successful
                        needle aspiration treatment or discharge with the
                        ambulatory device) were recorded as zero length of stay.
                        The 30­ day point was chosen on the basis of previous
                        data suggesting that most conservatively treated (non­
                        surgical) primary spontaneous pneumothorax air leaks
                        resolve within 14 days of initial treatment,8 and thus
                        outcomes measured at 30 days were considered reliably
                        to capture all related re­ admissions. Patients with
                        missing data at 1 week after treatment or 30 days after
                        randomisation were assumed to have no re­ admissions.
                        Re­ admission was defined as the need for emergency
                        (non­ planned) admission to hospital for any reason in
                        relation to pneumothorax but was not restricted to the
                        requirement for a further pleural intervention. Any re­
                        admission to hospital was recorded as at least a 1­ day
                        stay. Planned day case reviews for outpatient treated
                        patients were not included.
                    </p>
                    <p>Secondary outcomes included the need for a further
                        pleural procedure, adverse events, pain and breath­
                        lessness VAS scores, recurrence rates, and time of work
                        because of pneumothorax treatment. Further pleural
                        procedures were defined as any intervention that
                        punctured the pleura (eg, chest drain insertion) after
                        a first treatment intervention. We obtained a daily record
                        of thoracic pain and breathlessness scores using a VAS
                        score up to day 4 after randomisation, which was
                        measured on a scale of 0 to 100 mm. A score of 0 indicated
                        the complete absence of symptoms and 100 was the
                        maximum possible level of symptoms, which is validated
                        for assessment of breathlessness in patients having
                        pleural procedures.9,10 VAS scores were also recorded on
                        completion of treatment. Because patients could be
                        discharged with a small residual pneumothorax, those
                        with a persistent small pneumothorax at 1­ week follow­
                        up were defined as having ongoing pneumotho rax rather
                        than a new occurrence. The recurrence of pneumotho­
                        rax was defined as a new episode of symptomatic
                        pneumothorax after full resolution on chest radiograph,
                        or occurring after the 1­ week follow­ up visit. Several
                        other secondary outcomes including quality of life
                        questionnaires (EuroQol­ 5D­ 5L), blood parameters, and
                        digital air flow analysis are planned for separate
                        publications.
                    </p>
                    <p>Concerning the failure of medical treatment, there is no
                        robust evidence on the optimal timing for surgical
                        intervention in primary spontaneous pneumothorax after
                        initial treatment in the presence of ongoing air leak.
                        Current BTS guidelines suggest that cases of persistent air
                        leak or non­ re­ expansion should be referred for surgery
                        after 3–5 days.4 To achieve objective outcomes for this

                    <p>Safety data were collected for all patients at each trial
                        visit regarding adverse events, with seriousness denfied as
                        per Good Clinical Practice guidelines.11 Expected adverse
                        events were pain at the drainage site, minor haemorrhage
                        not requiring specicfi intervention (eg, blood transfusion
                        or surgery), subcutaneous emphysema, pleural infection,
                        unintentional removal (falling out) of the Pleural Vent or
                        chest tube, recurrence of pneumothorax or worsening of
                        ongoing pneumothorax (if evidence of failure of full
                        resolution following initial intervention), re­ expansion
                        pulmonary oedema, and the need for further (non­
                        emergency) pleural procedures. Expected serious adverse
                        events included tension pneumothorax occurring during
                        treatment, blockage of chest tube with clinical con­
                        sequences (eg, patient unwell or further procedure
                        required), major intrathoracic haemorrhage requiring
                        specicfi intervention (eg, blood transfusion), and any
                        additional emergency pleural procedure as deemed
                        necessary by the local investigator (eg, large bore chest
                        tube insertion). Because the recurrence of pneumothorax
                        is common and expected (occurring in about 33%
                        of primary spontaneous pneumothorax cases within
                        1 year1,12), recurrence was not reported as a serious adverse
                        event. Adverse events were assessed locally, and, if they
                        fullfiled the criteria for a serious adverse event, 13 they were
                        reported immediately (ie, within 24 h) to the Oxford
                        Respiratory Trials Unit for review. All serious adverse
                        events were followed until resolution.

                        from a mean of 4 days admission in patients receiving
                        standard care to an expected mean of 1·7 days in patients
                        receiving ambulatory care (standard deviation in both

                        correction factor for non­ normal data. These estimates
                        assume that up to 50% of patients receiving standard care
                        were expected to be successfully treated with aspiration
                        alone (ie, zero­ day admission). It was assumed, conser­
                        vatively, that about 20% of patients in the ambulatory care
                        arm would require re­ admission. Based on these param­
                        eters, with 80% power, a 5% two­ sided signicfiance level,
                        and a 10% attrition rate, the study required 236 patients.
                        Previous pleural studies have shown an attrition rate for
                        the primary outcome measure of less than 5%.14–16

                    <p>The Mann­ Whitney U test was used for the primary
                        analysis. The median hospital stay (expected to be non­
                        normally distributed) was calculated for each group,
                        and the 95% confidence interval for median diference
                        was calculated using an exact method. Pre­ planned
                        sensitivity analyses were done to assess the robustness
                        of the primary outcome. Survival analysis techniques
                        were used to compare time to discharge between the
                        two groups using the Gehan­ Breslow­ Wilcoxon test
                        (more appropriate than the log­ rank test because
                        of a high early event rate in primary spontaneous
                        pneumothorax) and using Cox proportional hazards
                        regression to calculate a hazard ratio and associated
                        95% confidence interval. An analysis of hospital stay in
                        hours (instead of whole days) was done using identical
                        methods to the primary analysis. The Student’s t test
                        was used to compare mean diferences in length of stay.

                        was calculated with 95% confidence interval and p values.
                        Categorical secondary outcome measures were analysed

                            days in hospital) is shown in gfiure 2. The diefrence
                            in overall hospital stay during 30 days was also signif­

                            done (ie, who proceeded directly to chest drain insertion
                            as per clinician preference). Removing the 31 (26%) of
                            119 patients in whom no aspiration was attempted in the
                            standard care arm, the primary outcome still favoured
                            the intervention arm. The median length of stay for

                            was done was 3 days (IQR 0–8), and the median
                            diference was 1 (95% CI 0–3; p=0·0001).

                            a recurrence (appendix p 7). The proportion of patients
                            with recurrence at day 7 was lower in the ambulatory care
                            group (8 [7%] of 110 patients) than in the standard care
                            group (19 [19%] of 110 patients; p=0·02). Of 19 patients
                            receiving standard care with recurrence, 10 (53%) were
                            initially treated with aspiration, vfie (26%) had aspiration

                        <p>All 14 serious adverse events occurred in patients who
                            received ambulatory care, and these events were all rated
                            as serious on the basis of the need for re­ admission to
                            hospital (table 5). Eight (57%) of the 14 serious adverse
                            events were related to the intervention (and some patients
                            had more than one serious adverse event): four (3%) of
                            117 patients receiving ambulatory care had an enlarging
                            pneumothorax on repeat chest radiography at outpa­
                            tient review, which required admission and chest tube
                            insertion; for two (2%) patients the device malfunctioned
                            (tube kinked or blocked); one (1%) patient had radio­
                            graphic evidence of (asymptomatic) pulmonary oedema at
                            review on day 1, but was admitted for observation without
                            overnight stay; one (1%) device was leaking uflid; the
                            device dislodged in one (1%) patient, requiring chest tube
                            placement; and one (1%) patient was admitted for suction.
                            The remaining four serious adverse events were haemo­
                            pneumothorax (n=3 [3%]) and pleurisy (n=1 [1%]), which
                            were all judged to be unrelated to the intervention. All
                            three patients with unrecognised haemopneumothorax
                            had chest radiographic evidence of signicfiant uflid (in
                            addition to pneumothorax) before the intervention. These
                            three patients either had surgery or CT angiography that
                            did not identify an intervention­ associated source of
                            bleeding.

                        <p>The most frequent non­ serious adverse events were
                            pain at the insertion site, haematoma or bleeding, surgical
                            or subcutaneous emphysema, and failure of the drainage

                        <p>This multicentre, open­ label, randomised controlled
                            trial compared an ambulatory treatment strategy for
                            primary spontaneous pneumothorax with standard care
                            using evidence­ based guidelines (aspiration, chest drain
                            insertion, or both), using clinically relevant outcomes
                            including the duration of hospital stay during the first
                            30 days following intervention. The results show the
                            eficacy of the ambulatory strategy, with most patients
                            successfully managed as outpatients. This finding is
                            supported by analysis of the primary outcome by initial
                            hospital and overall stay in both whole days and number
                            of hours.
                        </p>
                        <p>Although 24 (21%) of 114 patients who had ambulatory
                            care required at least one further procedure, patients in
                            this group required significantly fewer procedures overall
                            than those who received standard care. Patients in
                            the ambulatory group had longer treatment duration
                            (ie, time with ambulatory device in place) than did the
                            standard care group (ie, time with chest drain in place).
                            This diference is probably due to a number of factors.
                            First, physicians might have been more cautious in
                            managing patients with the ambulatory device and left
                            the device in situ longer to ensure it was not removed too
                            soon. Second, because patients in the ambulatory care
                            group were being managed as outpatients and reviewed
                            every 24 h, there were fewer opportunities to assess
                            whether the pneumothorax had resolved than there were
                            for those with a chest tube, who were treated in hospital
                            and potentially reviewed many times per day.
                        </p>
                        <p>Serious adverse events, denfied as those needing
                            admission to hospital, occurred exclusively in the
                            ambulatory care arm. Serious adverse events related
                            to treatment included enlargement of pneumothorax
                            despite the ambulatory device being in place and device
                            blockage and kinking, requiring chest tube insertion
                            and hospitalisation. In the ambulatory care group,
                            three patients had unrecognised haemopneumothoraces,
                            which at review were not considered related to the inter­
                            vention. Although this higher rate of serious adverse
                            events is clearly important, by the nature of its denfiition it
                            is biased against the ambulatory arm. Insertion of a chest
                            tube (eg, after failed aspiration) and admission to hospital
                            was not a possible serious adverse event in the standard
                            care arm because this constituted normal care. Therefore,
                            any adverse event in a patient already hospitalised,
                            regardless of the primary intervention, requires careful
                            interpretation. Nonetheless, the increased adverse event
                            rate in the ambulatory arm should be accounted for when
                            using an ambulatory pneumothorax strategy.
                        </p>
                        <p>No signicfiant diefrences between intervention groups
                            were observed in secondary outcome measures in terms
                            of VAS pain or breathlessness scores, time of work, and
                            overall recurrence at 30 days. However, the pneumothorax
                            recurrence rate within 7 days of treatment completion was
                            higher in those who received standard care. Recurrence at
                            this early stage is unusual and is often presumed to be due
                            to enlargement of an ongoing pneumothorax. As a result,
                            investigators classiefid patients with pneumothorax
                            within 7 days into two categories: ongoing if there had
                            been incomplete re­ expansion on chest radiograph at
                            completion of treatment, or new recurrence if the
                            pneumothorax had fully resolved on the last chest
                            radiograph. The excess recurrence in patients receiving
                            standard care was not entirely due to patients treated with
                            aspiration alone, because they accounted for less than
                            53% of those with early recurrence.

                            similar between the two groups. Despite excess recurrence
                            in the standard care arm by 30 days, the cumulative rate of
                            rifst ipsilateral recurrence was not statistically diefrent at
                            12 months. The overall rate of recurrence (27%) is
                            consistent with previous large epidemiological studies.1,12

                        <p>A 2020 randomised trial3 in primary spontaneous
                            pneumothorax compared conservative management (ie, no
                            intervention) with standard care (ie, chest tube insertion),3
                            reporting that the conservative approach was non­ inferior
                            to standard care in the primary outcome of resolution of
                            pneumothorax on chest radiograph at 8 weeks. We have
                            concerns about the widespread adoption of this approach.
                            First, the trial screened more than 2600 patients to ran­
                            domly assign 316, and it required 39 sites recruiting for
                            6 years. Excluding patients with previous pneumothorax
                            would automatically exclude about 25% of the population.
                            The reasons for which all other patients were excluded in
                            the trial are unclear. The trial might therefore be applicable
                            only to those patients with minimal symptoms, and it is
                            already recognised that conservative management is whol­
                            ly appropriate in some cases of primary spontaneous
                            pneumothorax (as stated in the 2010 BTS guidelines4).
                            Second, the primary outcome was radiological, rather than
                            patient­ centred (eg, symptoms, time in hospital). Few data
                            are presented on patient symptoms except at 2 weeks and
                            what was termed an overall satisfaction score. Therefore,
                            although the conservative treatment study should be
                            applauded for showing reduced inpatient hospital stay, we
                            would suggest that symptomatic patients who choose or
                            are chosen by the treating physicians for intervention
                            should be considered for the ambulatory treatment strategy,
                            which is shown here to be eefctive and reasonably safe.
                        </p>
                        <p>There are limitations to this study. Some eligible patients
                            were not enrolled because they presented out of the
                            0900–1700 National Health Service working hours or when
                            no trained members of staf were available. This factor
                            introduces a potential recruitment bias, because patients
                            presenting out of hours could be more unwell, and
                            thus ambulatory management should be used cautiously
                            in those patients. However, this prospective trial was
                            pragmatic in its design and the patients who enrolled
                            were likely to represent those suitable for ambulatory
                            management. The study was necessarily open label with
                            both patients and physicians aware of treatment allocation;
                            however, the use of objective and identical discharge
                            criteria were used for the primary outcome measure to
                            ensure balance between treatment groups. Finally, not all
                            patients in the standard care arm had pleural aspiration as
                            initial management, which could have introduced bias to­
                            wards the ambulatory arm. However, a post­ hoc analysis
                            excluding these patients showed that the primary outcome
                            remained signicfiantly diefrent between the two arms.
                        </p>
                        <p>Considering the data in the present study, what is now
                            the optimal treatment for patients with primary
                            spontaneous pneumothorax who require treatment? To
                            our knowledge, our results show for the rfist time
                            evidence of eefctive use of an entirely ambulatory strategy
                            in patients with symptomatic primary spontaneous
                            pneumothorax, as compared with current evidence based
                            standard care. The ambulatory strategy was associated
                            with reduced hospital stay and did not result in higher
                            surgical or recurrence rates, but it did show an increase in
                            adverse events related to readmission. Despite these
                            readmissions, the total number of pleural procedures
                            required and median hospital stay were signicfiantly lower
                            in patients in the ambulatory arm. These results have
                            important implications for practice and suggest that future
                            guidelines should include an ambulatory treatment option.
                            We argue that this study provides strong evidence that the
                            ambulatory strategy should replace the initial treatment
                            (both aspiration and chest tube insertion) that forms the
                            basis of current management guidelines. The ambulatory
                            device used in this trial was the Pleural Vent (Rocket
                            Medical). Ambulatory treatment might be just as eefctive
                            with any ambulatory treatment strategy (eg, a chest drain
                            attached to a one­ way valve), but other devices were not
                            tested in this study. It should be noted, however, that an
                            ambulatory treatment strategy for primary spontaneous
                            pneumothorax will require health­ care services to develop
                            ambulatory care facilities to allow patients to be safely
                            followed up with the device in situ.
                        </p>
                        <p>In conclusion, in patients with primary spontaneous
                            pneumothorax, ambulatory management signicfiantly
                            reduces the duration of hospital stay during 30 days.
                            Outpatient management is now a reasonable and probably
                            preferable option in the management of this condition.
